# Excel-to-txt

convert excel to text by python

need library os and openpyxl,easy install by pip

Put the excel file that you wish to convert in taget folder, I have put a example xlsx file for you to try the code, and the code will generate new directory for you according to the name of the excel file that you put in the /target directory.

for each collum there is a need to creat a new text file with the name of the 1st element in that collum delete empty text file as they are not needed suitable for  repeating conversion work, capable for multy file processing, i.e. more than 2 excel file
